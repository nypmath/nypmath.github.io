## About Me

I am a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn. 
I got my Ph.D. from Stony Brook University in May 2025, advised by <a href="https://scgp.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/bios/kenji-fukaya">Kenji Fukaya</a>. 

## Research Interests

I work in symplectic geometry. I am interested in homological mirror symmetry, low-dimensional topology and gauge theory. My current research focuses on building monoidal strucutures on the Fukaya categories through the geometry of Lagrangian fibrations.
