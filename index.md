## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Stony Brook University, advised by <a href="https://scgp.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/bios/kenji-fukaya">Kenji Fukaya</a>. 

I am on the job market this fall for postdoctoral positions.

## Research Interests

I work in symplectic geometry. I am interested in homological mirror symmetry, low-dimensional topology and gauge theory. My current research focuses on building monoidal strucutures on the Fukaya categories through the geometry of Lagrangian fibrations. You can find more details in my [research statement](assets/files/Research_Statement.pdf) (updated Nov 2024).
